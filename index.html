    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    <p>This is a short list of recipes I have compiled as a project to demonstrate that 
        I can display images, create links between pages, and create ordered and 
        unordered lists.</p>
    <p>I have also added some very basic CSS to show that I can adjust the "style" of the page.</p>
    <p class="enjoy">Enjoy the recipes!</p>
