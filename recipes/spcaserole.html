        <ul>
            <li>4 cups peeled, cubed sweet potatoes</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pecan Toppings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped pecans</li>
        </ul>            
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Prepare sweet potatoes: Put sweet potatoes in a medium 
                saucepan and cover with water. Cook over medium-high heat 
                until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and transfer to a 
                large bowl.</li>
            <li>Mash drained sweet potatoes with a fork. Add eggs; mix 
                until well combined. Add sugar, milk, butter, vanilla, and 
                salt; mix until smooth. Transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Make topping: Mix brown sugar and flour together in a 
                medium bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry cutter until 
                mixture is coarse and looks like peas; don't overmix. Stir 
                in pecans. Sprinkle topping over sweet potato mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is lightly browned, 
                about 30 minutes.</li>
